With the second elixir you wil be able to stand on green platforms and with the third elixir, your shots will follow the target. \n\n
        The first chest has<font color="#ADD8E6"> Jumpman\'s suit </font>, which allows you to access the first three secret areas.\n\n
        The final mini-boss is easy if you come prepared. Use the fire armor in the chests before the mini-boss to boost your damage and pick up the elixir in the room of the mini-boss. This way, you will need 4-5 shots to kill that spider.\n\n
    </string>

    <string name="dungeon33text">
        All three ðŸ’Ž can be found to the way, however, the last one can be accessed if you activate the button before the water pool with chest in it.\n\n
        The tornadoes deal damage on touch, cast thunders randomly or when they die and they also pull you towards them. Be sure to keep your distance before and after killing them. \n\n
        The second secret area is right above the first one.\n\n
        The third secret area cannot be seen that good on the picture, but you will be able to see the particles coming from the green platform on your screen.\n\n
    </string>

    <string name="dungeon34text">
        All three ðŸ’Ž are on the way to the dungeon end, you cannot miss them.\n\n
        The first secret area is right to the left of the start area and the third is right above the meeting place of the Moonkeeper. The second one can be opened by throwing swords to the jumping orb, so that it presses the button above it. \n\n
        Having equipment with a lot of speed and jump impulse is really helpful in the dungeon.\n\n
    </string>

    <string name="dungeon35text">
        All three ðŸ’Ž are on the way to the dungeon end, you cannot miss them.\n\n
        This is the first dungeon, which is considered as hard in the community. \n\n
        The dragon attacks every few seconds and his fireball goes to the position you were at the point when he fired it. You can use this advantage and hide behind blocks or jump really high so that the fireball does not hit you.\n\n
    </string>

    <string name="dungeon36text">
        All three ðŸ’Ž are on the way to the dungeon end, you cannot miss them.\n\n
        This is one of the previous dungeon you played as the dirty faced soldier, therefore, the first secret area is also the same. \n\n
        You have an additional fire elixir, which you can use if you prefer the fireball instead of homing missiles.\n\n
    </string>

    <string name="dungeon37text">
        All three ðŸ’Ž are on the way to the dungeon end, you cannot miss them.\n\n
        The first secret are is under the starting position, the second is on the right side of the first tower, and the third is on the left side of the second tower. \n\n
        Classes like Ranger, Rogue and Thief are really useful, since they provide the necessary agility for this dungeon.\n\n
    </string>

    <string name="dungeon38text">
        All three ðŸ’Ž are on the way to the dungeon end, you cannot miss them.\n\n
        If you had problems with killing your enemies because you have low damage, this is the place where you should maybe stop and farm more gold and get better equipment. Try getting at least 2 thousand weapon damage. \n\n
        The first secret are is above the first tree you find in the dungeon. Just jump on the tree and you will see a small platform on the top left. The second secret area is above the first jumping giant you meet.\n\n
    </string>

    <string name="dungeon39text">
        All three ðŸ’Ž are after the portal in the middle of the map. Do not enter the portal immediately with the king. Jump over it and continue to the left.\n\n
        The first secret area can be accessed with the minion that spawns to the left of it. When the minion starts spawning, go to the doors of the secret area and just keep on going to the right until the minion steps on the button.\n\n
        The second secret area is at the left side of the last tower to the left. You have to climb there from the left side, too.\n\n
    </string>

    <string name="dungeon40boss1">
        There are no secret areas in this dungeon, it is a one big bossfight.\n\n
        The boss-fight includes fighting the warlock in his normal and beast form. While he is in his normal form, he will attack you by shooting fireballs, throwing lightning from the above and spawning his minions.\n\n
        You do not need any specific strategy to beat him, just be sure to have enough damage to quickly deal with him.\n\n
    </string>

    <string name="dungeon40boss2">
        The second part is a bit more tricky, mainly because his beast form has three attack patterns, which change depending on how much damage you dealt to him.\n\n
        Remember, the hardest part about this boss is realizing when he is about to change his attack pattern!\n\n
        In the first stage, he will come near you and attack you just like the jumping giant. This attack is easily avoidable. \n\n
        In the second stage he will slide towards you and then cause an are of effect explosion.\n\n
        In the third stage he will jump towards you and then when he comes to the ground he will also slide a bit. It is basically a combination of the first two stages.\n\n
    </string>

    <string name="dungeon41text">
        Two ðŸ’Ž are visible and on the way to the dungeon\'s end. One of them is hidden behind the destroyable rock in the rom of the second rolling mini-boss.\n\n
        The homing missiles of the flying spiked boss first targets the destructible rocks. Be sure not to destroy them in the room. If you do actually destroy the rocks, you can just step under the boss, so that the projectiles do not follow you.\n\n
        The fifth secret area can be opened by the button to the right of it.\n\n
    </string>

    <string name="dungeon42text">
        The ðŸ’Ž are hidden behind destructible rocks. Be sure to destroy everything in order to get them.\n\n
        Regarding the riddle: Look at the nearby stone, it shows you in which order you have to do the riddle.\n\n
        Be carefu about the rats that throw the poison bombs. After exploding, they release a poison cloud, which lasts for a few seconds.\n\n
    </string>

    <string name="dungeon42bonustext1">
        Unlock this stage by getting all three ðŸ’Ž in dungeon 42.\n\n
        In order to open the doors to the mini-boss room you have to activate the valves in the right order.\n\n
    </string>

    <string name="dungeon42bonustext2">
        The boss drops a decent ring called "Creepy Crawler", which can be used for all weapon types. \n\n
    </string>

    <string name="dungeon43text">
        The first ðŸ’Ž is after the first block boss. The other two are necessary to be collected if you want to make golems vulnerable.\n\n
        In order to deal damage to the block boss, he needs to land on the red barrels. Just stand on the side of a barrel and when the boss starts going down, go to the opposite direction.\n\n
        The boss at the end is also pretty easy to defeat, if you have enough damage. Just stand on one of the blocks on the side and attack him and his cristal from afar.\n\n
    </string>

    <string name="dungeon43bonustext1">
        Unlock this stage by getting all three ðŸ’Ž in dungeon 43.\n\n
        Before trying to kill the block boss, kill everyone else in the room.\n\n
    </string>

    <string name="dungeon43bonustext2">
        After all other minions are dead, the way to the red barrels will be much easier to access. \n\n
    </string>

    <string name="dungeon44text">
        All three ðŸ’Ž are on the way, however, you mostly need a golden key to open the doors to get them. Do not skip any areas beforehand.\n\n
        The third secret area is lso hidden behind destructible orange mass.\n\n
        Be sure to visit the sixth secret area, since it has a nice armor that will help you with the boss.\n\n
    </string>

    <string name="dungeon44bossfighttext1">
        Be sure to collect <font color="#FFA500"> Robe of Imminent Fires </font>from the sixth secret area in order to maximize your damage.\n\n
        The boss has three main attacks: sliding icicle, falling icicles and boulder throw.\n\n
        You are supposed to dodge while dealing damage at the same time while following the path shown in the picture.\n\n
        Your attack should be the following: activate your special ability, then activate your super ability, then spam basic attacks. Rinse and repeat.\n\n
    </string>

    <string name="dungeon44bossfighttext2">
        <font color="#FF0000">Warning:</font> If you do not deal enough damage until the sliding icicle breaks, the boss will start throwing boulders at you, which is pretty hard to dodge.\n\n
        When the boss enters the second stage his sliding icicle moves faster, his falling icicles now target your current position and he throws multiple boulders.\n\n
